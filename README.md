# Wink Image Manipulation

This package is aimed to provide simple support for image manipulation for [Mohamed Said's](https://twitter.com/themsaid) [Wink](https://github.com/writingink/) publishing package.

## Install
```
composer require twoheads-digital/wink-image-manipulation
```

## Apply to custom model

Create a new model to extend the default WinkPost model.


```php
<?php

namespace App;

use Wink\WinkPost;
use WinkImageManipulation\Traits\ImageManimulation;

class BlogPost extends WinkPost
{

    use ImageManipulation;

    /**
     * @var array
     */
    protected $images = [
        'winkListingImage' => [
            'w' => 400,
            'h' => 300,
            'fit' => 'crop'
        ],
        'winkHeaderImage' => [
            'w' => 1680,
            'h' => 916,
            'fit' => 'crop'
        ]
    ];

}
```

Define all your images parameters in the `$images` property. Please make sure all named definitions begin with `wink` and end with `Image`.

You can then use definitions as model methods in your views;

```blade
<img src="{{ $post->winkListingImage() }}" />
// https://example.test/image/aefba831-12f7-4b58-9b62-c1e5c6f97994/winkListingImage
```
